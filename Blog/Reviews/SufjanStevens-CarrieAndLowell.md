        <p><em>Carrie & Lowell</em> turns 10 this year, and with it comes a deluxe edition featuring demos and alternate versions of the original tracks. Listening to it again, it still feels like one of the rawest pieces of music I’ve ever experienced.</p>

        <p>The production is minimal. Most of the songs are built around just a simple guitar or piano line. The tracks move between being completely dry and unfiltered to being soaked in reverb, but either way, the grief is impossible to miss. It feels like you're sitting in the room with him while he's trying to process something he can't fully explain.</p>

        <p>This is an album about Sufjan’s grief, and his grief alone. It’s a personal reflection on his complicated relationship with his mother, Carrie, who struggled with substance abuse and was rarely present in his life. It’s also about Lowell, his stepfather, who was married to Carrie for five years when Sufjan was a kid, and stayed in his life even after the divorce, long after Carrie had disappeared again. This isn’t a universal story, and it doesn’t try to be. The lyrics are incredibly specific, but what cuts through is the emotion itself. The shape of grief is powerful enough to take you back to your own moments of pain, even if the details are different.</p>

        <p>Even Sufjan has said he finds it hard to listen to this album now. Each song feels like him trying to draw meaning from the loss of someone he never really understood. That need to reflect on something you may never fully grasp is what makes <em>Carrie & Lowell</em> so devastating. Every track feels like part of that process.</p>

        <p><em>Death with Dignity</em> opens the album not with mourning, but with the absence of it. Grieving not the death, but the lack of a real relationship when she was alive. <em>Should Have Known Better</em> sits in the days just after her passing, when he isn’t ready to fully grieve. <em>Eugene</em> goes back to a time in Oregon, when Carrie and Lowell were still together and her life was briefly more stable. <em>Fourth of July</em> is a quiet and eerie conversation with her in the ICU, just before she died of cancer.</p>

        <p>Each track serves a different part of that emotional reflection. There’s no clean narrative arc, and it’s not supposed to have one. It’s messy, confusing, and unresolved, because that’s what grief often is.</p>
