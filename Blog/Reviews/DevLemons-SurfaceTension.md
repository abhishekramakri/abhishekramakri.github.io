    <div class="review-content">
        <p><em>Surface Tension</em> is the debut album of YouTuber and alt-pop musician Dev Lemons. Dev has been making music-related content for years, initially starting with her channel <em>SongPsych</em>, where she created video essays on various music topics. She first made a name for herself with her 2021 single <em>Guessing Games</em>, a stripped-back bedroom pop ballad about her romantic woes, something you will quickly notice is a recurring theme in her music. Later on, her personality began to shine through more clearly with loud, playful singles like <em>CEO of My Ass</em> and <em>One Whole Me</em>, which showcased her in-your-face vocal delivery and hectic, chaotic production.</p>

        <p>Fast forward a few years and you enter her Queef Jerky era. If you are a hiring manager reading my website, I am deeply sorry, I did not choose her artist names. This period is where her silliness and loudness fully come into form, especially with the TikTok-popular track <em>Pineapple Upsidedown</em>. I have always enjoyed Dev's music here and there, but what really caught my attention was the string of singles leading up to the album. <em>FREAK SHOW</em> and <em>Give Mama a Hug</em> are fantastic tracks that saw her venturing into a more post-punk and noise rock direction, which I think suits her abrasive vocal delivery extremely well. I highly recommend giving <em>Give Mama a Hug</em> a listen.</p>

        <p>This finally brings us to <em>Surface Tension</em>. While it unfortunately does not fully follow through on the heavy rock aesthetics suggested by the earlier singles, the album instead leans into a heavy alt-pop sound packed with banger after banger. The album seems to center around her romantic relationships in a loose sequence. <em>NICE TRY</em> and <em>MEDIA TRAIN</em> are braggadocious tracks that focus on how unattainable she is to this person and question why they would ever think they had another chance with her. <em>FACE</em> and <em>DONT PINCH ME</em> move toward portraying this person as a chronic liar and emotionally childish, a recurring idea throughout the album. <em>STUCK AGAIN</em> explores the feeling of being trapped in a relationship dynamic where you are unsure whether it is even worth letting yourself feel again. If you let yourself open up and realize it is not what you want, you are stuck, and if they leave, you have only opened yourself up to more hurt. <em>WHAT ABOUT YOU</em> shifts into questioning what her partner actually wants now that they are in this situation. Finally, <em>NOTHING CHANGES</em> closes the album with the idea that no matter what she says or does, nothing ever changes, ending on the question of why she still feels bad for this person.</p>

        <p>Instrumentally, this album is fantastic. Her production choices reflect the emotional tone extremely well. <em>NICE TRY</em> matches its braggadocious attitude with a plucky, energetic instrumental. <em>DONT PINCH ME</em> features a searing, deep bassline paired with an extremely distorted guitar that builds into controlled chaos, with her vocals tripled to sound shrill and confrontational. <em>FACE</em> uses a stripped-back, crunchy guitar line that makes the song feel intimate before allowing it to grow into something more maximal. <em>BROKE YOUR COVER</em> opens elegantly with an ambient pad and continually adds layers until it feels larger than life. Each song has such a strong and engaging instrumental palette that it is easy to stay invested throughout the album. My only minor gripe is that her vocals occasionally feel slightly overprocessed, and she often reuses the idea of warping the song's key toward the end of tracks.</p>

        <p>My biggest criticisms of the album largely come from its lyrical scope. Dev is extremely compelling at saying exactly what she means and using her vocal delivery to sell those emotions, but I do feel that she does not explore as wide a range of emotional ideas as I would have liked. I really appreciate what she does touch on, but from my perspective, several songs retread similar concepts and dynamics with the same person, which is something I am not always a fan of on an album this brief. That said, this is still an incredibly impressive debut from an indie artist. The production is excellent, her vocal delivery is unbelievably infectious, and I am very excited to see where she takes her sound next.</p>
