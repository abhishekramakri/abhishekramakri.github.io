        <p><i>Ghostholding</i> is the debut album for the moniker <i>venturing</i>, a side project from underground Indietronica legend Jane Remover. This album acts somewhat like a spiritual successor to her previous effort, <i>Census Designated</i>, both lyrically and sonically. To understand this album, it's important to grasp her shift in sound.</p>

        <p>Jane Remover, going by Dltzk at the time, gained notoriety for pioneering a style dubbed dariacore, a subgenre of electronic music characterized by pitch-shifted pop samples, breakbeats, and Jersey club influences. Through her various EPs like <i>Teen Week</i>, she began gaining popularity, culminating in her debut album <i>Frailty</i>. This album represented the peak of the sound she had been developing up to that point: maximalist, frantic, and bit crushed to high hell.</p>

        <p>Following this era, significant life changes led to a whole new sound. In 2022, she came out as transgender and adopted the moniker Jane Remover, simultaneously releasing the first single for the upcoming album, <i>Cage Girl</i> (a track later reworked into <i>Cage Girl / Cam Girl</i>). This track foreshadowed everything her subsequent album, <i>Census Designated</i>, would be: a fusion of indie rock, shoegaze, and electronic elements. Instead of being incredibly glitchy, this album is grounded in fuzzy, dense guitars, replacing digital chaos with more analog instrumentation.</p>

        <p>Not to make this review too focused on <i>Census Designated</i>, but I can't overstate just how amazing that album is. The dense guitars, clean drums, noise, fuzz, piercing vocals, and the mixing/mastering on a track like <i>Backseat Girl</i> are truly generational. With this project, she genuinely pushed the envelope of what is possible in noise rock, without sacrificing melodic quality for the sake of gritty, unpolished sounding rock.</p>

        <p>Now, here is where <i>Ghostholding</i> comes in. Following the natural progression, <i>Ghostholding</i> is a slacker rock album that takes the qualities of <i>Census Designated</i> and makes them cleaner and more polished, for better or worse. The sound of this album is relatively consistent throughout. She employs guitar riffs layered with fuzz and distortion, heavily stereo widened, drums typically panned distinctly to one side that cut through the mix, and vocals that sit nicely on top. Although at some points this mixing and song structure may feel a bit repetitive, the subject matter and catchiness of her songwriting keep the album engaging throughout.</p>

        <p><i>Ghostholding</i> dives into themes of relationship insecurity, intense attachment, and self reflection. Throughout the album, she  captures the anxiety and longing felt in romantic relationships in a vivid and relatable way. Tracks like <i>Playing My Guitar</i> illustrate the paradox of closeness that brings comfort but also restlessness, while <i>Guesthouse</i> perfectly articulates the emotional ups and downs of a toxic relationship, swinging from thrilling newness to inevitable heartbreak.</p>

        <p><i>Ghostholding</i> also tackles broader personal and social themes like fame, self identity, and emotional emptiness. In <i>Recoil</i>, Remover openly discusses her complicated feelings towards her career and the contradictions of seeking fame. <i>Dead Forever</i> criticizes the music industryâ€™s exploitation of young artists, echoing ideas she's explored before. Meanwhile, <i>Sister</i> delves into deeper personal battles, dealing with cycles of emptiness, escapism, and reliance on substances, capturing her ongoing search for genuine happiness and meaning.</p>

        <p>While I ultimately believe this album is great, there is a bit of grit that I miss. There isn't a track that is as chaotic and emotionally devastating as some tracks from <i>Census Designated</i>, such as <i>Fling</i>, <i>Backseat Girl</i>, or the title track <i>Census Designated</i>. However, this also has its positives. No track here is overly gritty like <i>Contingency Song</i>, which can make it less enjoyable to listen to. Overall, this album offers a great melancholic experience that showcases her musical capabilities, and I am very excited to see how her upcoming album under the Jane Remover moniker, <i>Revengeseekerz</i>, compares.</p>
