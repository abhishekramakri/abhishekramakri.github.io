        <p>With their new studio album coming out, and the first without frontman Isaac Wood, I figured it was time for me to visit <i>For the first time</i>, the debut from art rock outfit <i>Black Country, New Road.</i> This band is pretty different from most of what I listen to because almost everything is recorded live. The group includes saxophone, flute, violin, electric guitar, bass, drums, and vocals, creating a layered and unpredictable sound. Reviewing this kind of music feels like a shift for me. It's not just about whether it sounds new or gritty, but about the full composition and what it's trying to say, so I’ll be reviewing it that way.</p> 
        <p>Before getting into the album itself, I want to give a bit of background. So far, I’ve only listened to their second album, <i>Ants From Up There</i>, which is beautifully composed and thematically structured. It gives a clear look into the anxious and depressive state of Isaac Wood, who left the band soon after to focus on his mental health. That album builds to an emotional high point with <i>The Place Where He Inserted the Blade</i> and the heartbreaking closer <i>Basketball Shoes</i>.</p> 
        <p>Compared to that, <i>For the first time</i> is structured differently. It has only six songs but still runs about 40 minutes. It feels more like a mix of ideas than a single, focused concept like <i>AFUT</i>.</p> 
        <p>The sound here is lush and consistent. The band uses similar techniques across tracks to hold everything together. As much as I’d like to break down each track instrumentally, I know that would probably get too long, so I’ll keep it short. The album opens with <i>Instrumental</i>. What makes a group like this special is that anyone can step into focus at any time. Their parts blend together so well that you don’t always notice when the lead shifts. The synth lead is the one constant. Otherwise, the sax, bass, and drums all take turns driving the song. It moves steadily and ends on a powerful note.</p> 
        <p>The next track, <i>Athens, France</i>, is especially interesting. It was their debut single, though the version on the album is different. The original lyrics were about insecurities in an uneven relationship, both emotionally and sexually. On the album, the lyrics change. Now the focus is more on regret and anxiety around how his words might be misread. Some fans thought the original lyrics suggested he had been assaulted, which wasn’t the case. The newer version reflects on that misunderstanding and the pressure of being interpreted in ways you can’t control.</p> <p>This confusion is part of what makes BC,NR stand out. Wood’s writing is deeply personal and self-critical. At times it’s also arrogant and filled with wild, sexual imagery. His persona is dramatic and sad, and since he’s not a reliable narrator, you’re never quite sure how to feel about him. That tension keeps you listening.</p> 
        <p><i>Science Fair</i> is a darker, more dissonant track. It’s stripped back and almost chaotic, like a breakdown in real time. He talks about feeling like a poser, caught up in delusions and then crashing into shame. <i>Sunglasses</i> starts out beautifully, with guitar and sax circling each other. The first half is about meeting a partner’s much wealthier family and feeling out of place. The second half spirals into something more chaotic, turning the sunglasses into a metaphor for a desperate attempt at confidence, a way to mask insecurity, class anxiety, and emotional instability while everything quietly falls apart underneath.</p> 
        <p><i>Track X</i> is a big shift in tone. It’s much softer and focused on the small details of love and intimacy. It loses the chaos of earlier tracks and brings in something more peaceful. This leads into the final track, <i>Opus</i>, which wraps things up by talking about how things fall apart and come back together. It also references their old band, Nervous Conditions, which broke up after their previous singer faced multiple assault allegations. From that, they rebuilt and created something new.</p> 
        <p>This album is raw and beautiful. That doesn’t mean it’s perfect. The strength of most tracks makes <i>Science Fair</i> feel a little weaker, even though the writing might be the sharpest on the album. I also don’t connect with <i>Sunglasses</i> all the way through, but that’s mostly a reflection of how strong the other songs are. Still, <i>For the first time</i> left me genuinely impressed. It’s chaotic, emotional, and rough around the edges in a way that feels honest, and I’m glad I finally gave it a full listen.</p>
