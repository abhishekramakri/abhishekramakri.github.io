        <p>Coming from North Carolina, Weston Estate is an alt-pop band with three primary singers, a guitarist, and a bassist. Known for their lo-fi indie sound, this EP sees them exploring some new territory. <em>SUPERBLOOM</em> is their second full EP, and while I do not love every part of it, I really respect the direction they are heading in.</p>

        <p>Instrumentally, this EP pulls from many of their established styles. <em>I Saw Something</em> is a cute, guitar-centered indie track with very comforting and full ambient pads. Where the song really shines, though, is in the second verse, where you can feel them experimenting with fuller sounds, like the heavier bassline. <em>Camouflage</em>, <em>GO!</em>, and <em>Pressure</em> all feature a similar production style that, while very pleasant, is not especially dynamic. These tracks often rely on the same structure of being centered around a guitar and slowly growing with larger ambient pads, which can start to feel repetitive across the EP.</p>

        <p>Where Weston Estate really comes into their own and show their potential is on <em>Thinking Out Loud</em>. The production here is truly fantastic. It perfectly blends their indie tendencies with more experimental choices. The distorted, washed-out guitar that opens the track, followed by the chopped elements and thoughtful arrangement, works extremely well. While the chorus still uses the same synth pad trick present throughout the EP, the additional production details help it feel more distinct. This momentum continues on <em>Temerity</em>, which also strays away from their typical indie sound. It is more stripped back, but that restraint works in its favor, as the track is layered very peacefully and intentionally. <em>Stop Me</em> serves as a solid closer, and while it does fall back into some of their earlier tendencies, I appreciate the experimentation with the reversed sidechain effect.</p>

        <p>Lyrically, I appreciate the simplicity, though I do think there is room for growth. Most of the songs center around a vague event and the turbulent relationship the narrator has with another person. <em>I Saw Something</em> focuses on catching someone cheating and wishing they had never seen it, with the paranoia and second-guessing that follows. <em>Camouflage</em> explores a relationship that fell apart because the narrator could not be enough emotionally, and his belief that he could do better if given another chance, even though that chance will never come. <em>Thinking Out Loud</em> revolves around distrust in a relationship where communication is lacking, but the narrator insists he would stay regardless, valuing the relationship despite the imbalance. Nearly every track touches on a similar emotional dynamic, which can make the EP feel thematically narrow.</p>

        <p>Even with its faults, I can clearly see the direction Weston Estate is trying to move toward. <em>SUPERBLOOM</em> is not perfect, but it shows a lot of promise. If they continue leaning into the more experimental ideas present on tracks like <em>Thinking Out Loud</em> and <em>Temerity</em>, I think they are capable of delivering a truly standout project in the future.</p>
