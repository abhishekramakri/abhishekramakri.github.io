    <div class="review-content">
            <p>This Album is Tragic. There's no better way to describe Deathconsciousness. It explores nihilism, existential despair, struggles with God, and cycles of destruction, painting a bleak picture of the human condition. The album is split into two distinct halves—The Plow That Broke the Plains and The Future—that differ in both sound and themes, so I'll break them down individually.</p>

            <p><h2>Part 1: The Plow That Broke the Plains</h2></p>
            <p>The album opens with A Quick One Before the Eternal Worm Devours Connecticut, an eight-minute track built around a repeating guitar melody. The swirling drones create a somber atmosphere that sets the tone perfectly. Bloodhail introduces the story of a hunter who confronts God to escape indifference and find meaning. By killing God, he gains freedom but destroys the framework that gave life meaning, leaving only emptiness. The story continues in Hunter, where God reflects on his fate as humanity celebrates his rejection. The perspective shifts between God's resignation and humanity's misguided sense of victory, glorifying the rejection of divinity despite its consequences.</p>

            <p>Loss and mortality take center stage in The Big Gloom, which focuses on a man contemplating suicide in an ice bath. It draws comparisons to Jean-Paul Marat's death and Jacob's Ladder, highlighting how others view his death more than his own experience. The track ends with 30 seconds of silence, giving the listener space to reflect. Telephone shifts to a more personal note, where the narrator yearns to communicate with a deceased loved one, likely his father.</p>

            <p>The first half is rich with theological and existential ideas, but the music occasionally falls short. The layered reverb and droning guitars create an immersive sound, but tracks like Hunter and Telephone feel overly abstract at times, losing some of their impact. Still, most tracks capture the intended atmosphere and emotional weight.</p>

            <p><h2>Part 2: The Future</h2></p>
            <p>The second half of the album shifts gears, offering a more direct and grounded take on similar themes. Holy Fucking Shit: 4000 examines predetermination, depicting humanity as programmed and incapable of accountability. Earthmover builds on this, presenting humans as machines of destruction, worn down by their purpose yet unable to escape it.</p>

            <p>Isolation and alienation also play a major role here. Deep, Deep questions why faith and love seem to result only in despair. It compares human intimacy to a sterile tango, leaving the narrator isolated and disconnected. I Don't Love is brutally straightforward, expressing a total absence of love and the desire to escape life's emptiness.</p>

            <p>The music in this half feels more cohesive and focused. I Don't Love uses a wall of noise to convey the overwhelming weight of despair, while Earthmover moves through distinct emotional stages, capturing the pain of existence and the frustration of being unable to escape it. These tracks feel more structured and impactful compared to some of the looser moments in the first half.</p>

            <p><h2>Final Thoughts</h2></p>
            <p>Deathconsciousness is a tragic and deeply reflective album. While its abstraction sometimes dulls its impact, the themes and emotions it explores hit hard. Its influence on underground music is clear, and its raw emotional core leaves a lasting impression.</p>
