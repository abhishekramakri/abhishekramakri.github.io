    <div class="review-content">
        <p>AM, the wildly successful fifth studio album by Arctic Monkeys, came at an interesting time in their career. To understand where this album comes from, you need some context about Arctic Monkeys’ career. Arctic Monkeys formed in 2002, but they only gained mainstream attention in the mid-2000s after their demos started circulating online. Their debut album, Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not, released in 2006, was met with wild acclaim from critics and audiences alike. With its heavy garage rock sound, the album had standout tracks like I Bet You Look Good on the Dance Floor and the more laid-back Mardy Bum.</p>

        <p>Their success continued with Favourite Worst Nightmare, which channeled the raw energy of their debut into a more polished indie rock sound. Alex Turner’s vocals became more melodic, yet the band kept the energetic highs that made their first album so exciting. The album’s outro track, 505, became hugely popular and hinted at the dreamier, atmospheric sound the band would explore in later works like Suck It and See.</p>

        <p>The release of Humbug and Suck It and See marked a dip in their mainstream visibility, though both albums still received positive reception from fans and critics. Humbug took the band in a darker, more experimental direction, while Suck It and See leaned into a softer, more melodic aesthetic. These albums didn’t achieve the same commercial success as their earlier work, but they expanded the band’s sound in pretty interesting ways. To regain some of their popularity while continuing to evolve, Arctic Monkeys needed to find a balance between the dreamy aesthetic and the more accessible indie rock. That’s exactly what they achieved with AM, an album that became a defining indie rock staple of the 2010s. With its slick production, groovy riffs, and mass appeal, AM solidified Arctic Monkeys’ as one of the most influential bands of the decade.</p>

        <p>Even though I'm a pretty big Arctic Monkeys fan, I was kind of surprised I'd never actually sat down and listened to this album. Maybe it was because of some of the criticisms I've seen online, or the fact that I haven't been diving into a lot of new music lately. Either way, I was pretty excited going into this one, especially since I already loved some of its big hits like Do I Wanna Know?, R U Mine?, and Why'd You Only Call Me When You're High?. After listening a few times, I can say I still very much enjoy it, but I do have some reservations.</p>

        <p>Starting with the positives, Arctic Monkeys are incredible at crafting infectious guitar riffs and memorable choruses. Even tracks like No. 1 Party Anthem, which feel like pretty standard danceable rock songs, still manage to be fun, even if they're not particularly groundbreaking. That said, not every track on the album pulls off the stripped-back vibe well enough to keep me fully engaged. Songs like Mad Sounds and I Want It All are definitely enjoyable when I'm doing other things, and they work in certain contexts, but they don't quite grab me enough to keep me invested when I'm just sitting and listening.</p>

        <p>Additionally, one area where AM feels a little lacking compared to earlier Arctic Monkeys albums is in its lyricism. Alex Turner has always had a knack for clever songwriting, especially in their first two records, where his lyrics felt like they captured everyday experiences in a witty way. On AM, however, the lyrics feel more straightforward and, at times, repetitive, often focusing on themes like late-night longing and fleeting romance. While this approach does work for the album’s radio-friendly sound, it doesn't quite reach the same level of sharpness or storytelling that made tracks like A Certain Romance or Fluorescent Adolescent so memorable. It's not bad, but it doesn’t leave much to unpack or revisit beyond the immediate surface-level appeal.</p>


        <p>All of that aside, I do like the album. I think I'm being a little harsher because I'd easily rate both Favourite Worst Nightmare and Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not as 9s. But for what it is, AM is a pretty solid indie rock album. It's the kind of album you could imagine your immigrant mom listening to and not complaining that it hurts her ears, and that's honestly a win in my book.</p>
