        <p>How are you gonna beat women and also make mediocre music? Pick a struggle, man.</p>

        <p>There is genuinely so little to say about this album. I couldn't really listen to it all the way through in one go because the dynamic range is so little that my ears got tired every 20 minutes. This album is textbook Carti. Fire loops that don't ever really evolve and become stale a minute and a half into the song. Lyrics that are essentially nonsense, which I can honestly excuse because Carti kinda treats his voice like an instrument, but that instrument is incredibly one-note.</p>

        <p>The features are either just as half-assed as Carti or absolutely carry the song. Thank you, my glorious king Skepta, for making <i>TOXIC</i> listenable. Why is Kendrick on this album three times though? I know he's not your savior, but that doesn't make him featuring on a Playboi Carti album any less insanely hypocritical after literally all of last year's beef.</p>

        <p>Also, 30 songs? Are you kidding me? I can't even call this album bloated because it's not like trimming it would make it any better. Most of the songs are equally mediocre. Nothing incredibly good, nothing that bad.</p>

        <p>Also side note, why didn't he include the single <i>ALL RED</i> in the album? That song is easily better than every song on this.</p>

        <p>I will give props where props are due. <i>EVIL J0RDAN</i> is pretty infectious with the DJ Swamp Izzo ad-libs in the style of DJ Drama. The beat on <i>COCAINE NOSE</i> is absolutely dirty, and Carti sounds genuinely aggressive, unlike on half the album. The beat on <i>OLYMPIAN</i> is so harsh yet still whimsical, and Carti’s silly little moans work too, I guess.</p>

        <p>Yeah, that's all I got for this review. Now that you've finally released the album, maybe you'll have time to visit your son. Lowkey, it might be better if you don’t though.</p>
