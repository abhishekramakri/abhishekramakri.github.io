            <h3>Amazon</h3>
            <div class="experience-meta">May 2025 – Aug 2025</div>
            <div class="experience-role">Software Developer Intern</div>
            <p>
                During my internship with Amazon in Seattle, I built a full end-to-end machine-learning model testing system for an internal SageMaker tool. 
                This let data scientists validate fraud-detection models directly in production without committing code, cutting development time roughly in half. 
                I also designed a secure cross-account deployment architecture that used UUID authentication, Java APIs, Python wrappers, and AWS services such as S3, DynamoDB, and Step Functions to automate model deployment workflows. 
                To support it all, I engineered an automated pipeline for Python packaging, secure uploads, and CloudWatch monitoring.

            <div class="experience-role">Undergraduate Research Assistant</div>
            <p>
            At the Binaural Hearing Lab, I contributed to the development of the CCi-Mobile cochlear implant research platform. My work focused on enhancing signal processing modules in MATLAB, particularly for generating electrodograms used in auditory experiments. I implemented and refined functions within the Advanced Combination Encoder (ACE) strategy, including audio preprocessing, automatic gain control, and FFT-based filterbanks. I also supported GUI development and real-time hardware streaming through an RF interface, enabling real-time stimulation for auditory research conducted under Dr. Justin Aranoff.

            <div class="experience-role">Software Developer Intern</div>
            <p>At COUNTRY Financial, I worked on a variety of impactful projects. I designed and implemented a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using Azure OpenAI and semantic chunking to improve how insurance policy information is retrieved. I also developed a proof of concept to migrate GitLab CI/CD runners to an Azure Kubernetes cluster, exploring cloud migration options while improving scalability. Along the way, I wrote unit tests to achieve 80% code coverage in the Ingestion & Curation Pipelines, helping ensure the reliability of the codebase. I automated routine tasks with the Qualys API, saving several hours each week, and collaborated with my team in an Agile environment, participating in daily standups and sprint planning.</p>

            <div class="experience-role">Undergraduate Research Assistant</div>
            <p>I’ve been collaborating on the DISSCO project under Dr. Sever Tipei, focusing on enhancing software for musical composition, sound synthesis, and notation. Using C++ and high-performance computing, I’ve worked on improving the system's capabilities and implementing statistically-driven applications of musical features within the composition module.</p>

            <div class="experience-role">Software Developer Intern</div>
            <p>During my time at JIFFY.ai, I worked on creating auto-generative user manuals by leveraging OpenAI’s and JIFFY.ai’s APIs to process input data. Additionally, I built a React demo page to showcase the platform’s various features, providing a user-friendly interface to highlight its capabilities. This work combined automation and design, offering a dynamic way to present and utilize JIFFY.ai’s functionality.</p>

            <div class="experience-meta">Feb 2025</div>
            <p>As part of a collaborative project, I developed a multiplayer web-based karaoke game that allows players to join remotely using their phones. I implemented post-performance pitch analysis using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and librosa for pitch detection, along with a caching system to pre-process reference vocals for faster analysis. Built with React, Express, Python, and WebSockets, the game ensures seamless host-player interactions and real-time audio analysis.</p>

            <div class="experience-meta">June 2024</div>
            <p>I worked on GeoGroove, a location-based music discovery tool that curates personalized Spotify playlists based on geographic regions. My role focused on implementing Spotify authentication to ensure seamless playlist creation and integration. The system leverages MusicBrainz to extract representative artists and uses Spotify’s API to rank them by popularity and fetch top tracks. Built with Python and Flask, GeoGroove enhances cultural immersion through music by allowing users to explore popular artists from specific locations.</p>
