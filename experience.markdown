            <p>At COUNTRY Financial, I worked on a variety of impactful projects. I designed and implemented a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using Azure OpenAI and semantic chunking to improve how insurance policy information is retrieved. I also developed a proof of concept to migrate GitLab CI/CD runners to an Azure Kubernetes cluster, exploring cloud migration options while improving scalability. Along the way, I wrote unit tests to achieve 80% code coverage in the Ingestion & Curation Pipelines, helping ensure the reliability of the codebase. I automated routine tasks with the Qualys API, saving several hours each week, and collaborated with my team in an Agile environment, participating in daily standups and sprint planning.</p>
