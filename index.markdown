        <h1>Hi, I'm Abhi Ramakrishnan</h1>

        <h2>Professional Journey</h2>
        <p>This year, I worked at COUNTRY Financial, where I designed and implemented a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using Azure OpenAI to optimize insurance policy retrieval. I also developed a POC to migrate GitLab CI/CD runners to Azure Kubernetes, saving $100k annually by enhancing scalability.</p>
        
        <p>Last summer, I interned at JIFFY.ai in Palo Alto, creating auto-generative user manuals using OpenAI's API and building a React demo page to showcase product features. At UIUC, I'm collaborating on the DISSCO project under Dr. Sever Tipei, leveraging high-performance computing to enhance music composition software.</p>
        
        <p>I've also developed projects like GeoGroove, a hackathon-winning app that curates playlists from specified locations using Spotify APIs, and a custom calendar tool to streamline assignment tracking for UIUC students.</p>

        <h2>Music in my Life</h2>
        <p>Music has always been a big part of my life. I played the cello for over ten years, performed with the Elgin Youth Symphony Orchestra in high school, and lately, I’ve been learning acoustic guitar and piano. I love making music and listening to it, and understanding the technical side, like digital signal processing, just makes it even cooler.</p>

        <p>What I love most about music is how it can completely change the way you feel and express yourself. There are so many genres and subgenres that seem hard to get into at first, but once you do, they open up a whole new way of experiencing emotions and ideas. Back in high school, I mostly listened to rap-adjacent stuff and couldn’t really imagine branching out, but now I’m into everything from folk to shoegaze. No matter what, I’m always finding new ways music hits me.
