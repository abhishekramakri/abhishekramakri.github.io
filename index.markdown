        <h2>Professional Journey</h2>
        <p>
            I recently interned at Amazon, where I built an end-to-end ML model testing system on SageMaker and designed a secure cross-account deployment workflow with AWS services. Earlier, at COUNTRY Financial, I created a Retrieval-Augmented Generation system using Azure OpenAI and a proof of concept to migrate GitLab CI/CD runners to Azure Kubernetes, projected to save $100k annually.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also contributed to cochlear-implant research at the Binaural Hearing Lab, enhancing MATLAB signal-processing modules and supporting real-time RF hardware streaming. Previously, I interned at JIFFY.ai, developing auto-generative user manuals with OpenAI’s API and a React demo page, and collaborated on the DISSCO project at UIUC to improve music-composition software with high-performance computing.
        </p>
        <p>
            My projects include GeoGroove, a hackathon-winning location-based playlist generator using Spotify APIs, and a custom calendar tool that streamlines assignment tracking for UIUC students.

        <h2>Music in my Life</h2>
        <p>Music has always been a big part of my life. I played the cello for over ten years, performed with the Elgin Youth Symphony Orchestra in high school, and lately, I’ve been learning acoustic guitar and piano. I love making music and listening to it, and understanding the technical side, like digital signal processing, just makes it even cooler.</p>

        <p>What I love most about music is how it can completely change the way you feel and express yourself. There are so many genres and subgenres that seem hard to get into at first, but once you do, they open up a whole new way of experiencing emotions and ideas. Back in high school, I mostly listened to rap-adjacent stuff and couldn’t really imagine branching out, but now I’m into everything from folk to shoegaze. No matter what, I’m always finding new ways music hits me.
