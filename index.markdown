        <h1>Hi, I'm Abhi Ramakrishnan</h1>

        <h2>Professional Journey</h2>
        <p>This year, I worked at COUNTRY Financial, where I designed and implemented a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using Azure OpenAI to optimize insurance policy retrieval. I also developed a POC to migrate GitLab CI/CD runners to Azure Kubernetes, saving $100k annually by enhancing scalability.</p>
        
        <p>Last summer, I interned at JIFFY.ai in Palo Alto, creating auto-generative user manuals using OpenAI's API and building a React demo page to showcase product features. At UIUC, I'm collaborating on the DISSCO project under Dr. Sever Tipei, leveraging high-performance computing to enhance music composition software.</p>
        
        <p>I've also developed projects like GeoGroove, a hackathon-winning app that curates playlists from specified locations using Spotify APIs, and a custom calendar tool to streamline assignment tracking for UIUC students.</p>

        <h2>Music in my Life</h2>
        <p>Outside of work and research, music has always been a significant part of my life. Iâ€™ve played the cello for over 10 years, performed with the Elgin Youth Symphony Orchestra during high school, and am now learning acoustic guitar. I enjoy both creating and listening to music, and learning about the technical aspects like dynamic range processing and delay lines makes the experience even more fulfilling.</p>

        <p>One of my favorite things about listening to music is revisiting songs that initially challenged me and discovering their depth. Back in high school, I was mostly into rap-adjacent genres and couldn't imagine listening to anything else. Now, I find myself listening to everything from folk to pop-punk to shoegaze, always finding new ways in which music helps me connect to new emotions and experiences.</p>
