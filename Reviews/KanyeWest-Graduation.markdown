    <div class="review-content">
        <p>Yeah, I finally listened to it. Maybe it is because I prefer Kanye's more outlandish albums like <i>The Life of Pablo</i> and <i>Ye</i> over his classics like <i>The College Dropout</i> (I know this is a terrible take), but I never felt insanely inclined to listen to it. I was sure it could not possibly live up to the hype but it absolutely did. Saying I have not listened to this album before is not exactly fair though. This is one of those albums that is so quintessential that even though I have never listened to it back to front, I have definitely heard a good amount of the standout tracks, like <i>Flashing Lights</i>, <i>I Wonder</i>, and of course <i>Stronger</i>.</p>

        <p>There is so much positive to say about this album, so I will get the negative out of the way first. I am not a big fan of beats like <i>Barry Bonds</i>. The lack of dynamic aspects makes me yearn for when the beat becomes full for a brief moment, because that is the only time it feels like it fulfills its potential. Of course, we also need to talk about <i>Drunk and Hot Girls</i>. What the hell is this song? I can admit it is very endearing at the beginning, but there is no excuse for the pre chorus and chorus to play four times. This song is literally the longest track on <i>Graduation</i>. Also, are we going to talk about how he insinuates that he only wanted a one night stand with this drunk girl but got her pregnant? Consent is important Mr. West.</p>

        <p>Now that I have gotten this out of my system, we need to talk about how fantastic the production is. Kanye is known for his talent in making soulful vocal chops, but his ability to fuse these elements with electropop aesthetics is what makes this album truly remarkable. The way he can take a song heavily sampling electronic legends like Daft Punk and create an incredible upbeat pop rap track like <i>Stronger</i>, then place it right behind a beautiful synth and soul track like <i>I Wonder</i> and still make it work is the mark of an incredible artist. On this album, Kanye has perfected the art of making his production palatable to a larger audience without sacrificing the unique Kanye flairs that make Kanye Kanye.</p>

        <p>From a lyrical perspective, Kanye continues to do what he does best, make witty bars, self aggrandize, and reflect on himself. On tracks like <i>Good Morning</i> and <i>Champion</i>, you hear Kanye focus on the various aspects of his career, like his work ethic and his rise to fame, with a respectful amount of arrogance in the process. He balances this out by having more reflective tracks like <i>Big Brother</i>, where he talks about the good and bad of his relationship with Jay Z, and <i>Everything I Am</i>, where he reflects on feeling like an outsider compared to other celebrities.</p>

        <p>We cannot forget the most prominent theme of the album, celebration. This entire album is a celebration of everything he has accomplished and how we should celebrate his success. <i>Stronger</i> talks about his pursuit of greatness and perseverance, <i>The Glory</i> revels in his success and how hard work got him to where he is, and <i>Good Life</i> is the ultimate screw you to the haters while he continues to make more money.</p>

        <p>On a personal level, as an Illinois boy myself, I resonate with the way <i>Homecoming</i> personifies Chicago and explores its influence on his artistry. His ambitions for greater success ultimately led him to leave, and that really sticks with me. I know I am going to have to leave Illinois to pursue the dreams I want to fulfill, and it is scary since I have never left Illinois for an extended period of time. While I am worried my relationship with home will change and I will become more detached from it, like Kanye, I know it will always be a part of who I am.</p>

        <p>Anyways, less about me, more about the album. The feature choices here are incredible, and besides Lil Wayne on <i>Barry Bonds</i>, everyone fulfills a crucial role. The pop rap standouts, from <i>Stronger</i> to <i>Flashing Lights</i>, have absolutely stood the test of time and continue to get better every day. For Kanye himself, this is the album that took him from a hip hop fan favorite to absolute stardom. It had a massive impact on hip hop culture, ushering in a new wave of rap, helping kill the bling era, and creating a new fashion wave. The album is cohesive and maintains a consistent narrative throughout. The critical and audience praise it receives is absolutely deserved, and it will continue to stand the test of time even if Kanye himself does not.</p>
