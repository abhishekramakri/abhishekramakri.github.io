        <p>I've been listening to too much good music recently so this is a nice change of pace. Most Spotify streams in a single day for <i>this</i>? ðŸ’€</p>

        <p>To get the good out of the way so I can talk about the bad, Drake's poetic stream of consciousness writing style is actually pretty effective at times. He is also the king of making bars that upper middle class guys will put as their Instagram captions, like "If it was ride or die then you should have been dead right now" and "And if money is all I need in my grave then bury me now."</p>
        
        <p>The intro track, <i>Champagne Poetry</i>, is a smooth opener where Drake talks the talk the way he knows how. Loyalty and betrayal, success and exhaustion. <i>Fair Trade</i> is just Drake and Travis Scott doing what they do best, being relentlessly arrogant while melodically crooning over spacey trap beats, creating an undeniably catchy track.</p>
        
        <p>I think I need to go against the grain here. <i>Way 2 Sexy</i> is genuinely hilarious. The sharp drums, anthemic synths, and charismatic Future chorus make this song so infectious. Even Drake's horrendous verse cannot ruin how undeniably electric the production is. Future and Drake play off each other well even when the production is not super dynamic and neither of them is delivering a remarkable performance. <i>Yebbaâ€™s Heartbreak</i> is very pretty. Nothing mind blowing but a nice change of pace for the album.</p>
        
        <p><i>Knife Talk</i> is such an interesting case. If you have not heard the original song that the Project Pat sample is from, <i>Feed the Streets</i> by Juicy J is significantly better than this. However, <i>Knife Talk</i> definitely has its charm. When Drake gets on a track with 21 Savage and they both go in on Southern beats it is a sure fire way to make a banger.</p>
        
        <p>This is as far as I can compliment this album.</p>
        
        <p>There is some bias I need to get out of the way before I properly explain why I do not like this album. I hate his vocal chain so much. I hate how EQed his voice is. Especially on songs that are not very dynamic this becomes way more noticeable. Take <i>Girls Want Girls</i> where the pad in the background sits heavy in the mids. His vocal performance is not dynamic either but the song could at least sound better if they just EQed his voice properly so you could feel the bass in it. A great example of this done right is <i>Nonstop</i>. His voice is not overprocessed and you can actually hear a bit of the rasp at the bottom of his register.</p>
        
        <p>His production is not doing him any favors either. <i>Girls Want Girls</i> has the most uninspired piano pad progression and generic drums. And honestly that exact description applies to way too many songs on this album. <i>In the Bible</i>. <i>No Friends in the Industry</i>. <i>7AM on Bridle Path</i>. <i>F*****ing Fans</i>. <i>The Remorse</i>. The list just keeps going.</p>
        
        <p>And we need to talk about the pitched up vocal samples. Bro wants to be Kanye so bad but he does not fundamentally understand why Kanyeâ€™s vocal samples work. You cannot just find a random woman singing, throw some reverb and a low pass filter on it, and call it a day. He follows the exact same sampling technique over and over again until all you can do is drop to your knees and pray that he at least makes another <i>Scorpion</i> because the <i>Take Care</i> days are long gone.</p>
        
        <p>"Say that you a lesbian girl me too"</p>
        <p>"Said you belong to the streets but the streets belong to me it is like home to me"</p>
        <p>What else is there even to say.</p>
        
        <p>I can absolutely get behind unapologetically toxic music if the music itself is good enough to back it up. Hell I love Arctic Monkeys and The Weeknd. But this is different. Drakeâ€™s whole persona of being the toxic lover who breaks hearts but also somehow always gets his heart broken is just so queasy. And then right after that he will hit you with a song about how fame makes him lonely and isolated.</p>
        
        <p>Oh poor Drake. I am so sorry you feel alone despite being a serial cheater who signs smaller artists just to stunt their careers and prop up your own.</p>
        
        <p>And as a final note women are not status symbols. Whether he is admiring them or resenting them Drake always positions himself as if he is entitled to their loyalty and respect. He views them like a reward or a trophy rather than as individual people.</p>
        
        <p>That is it. I would love to say I am disappointed but that would require me to have had any expectations in the first place.</p>
