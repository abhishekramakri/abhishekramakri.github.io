        <p>AM, the fifth studio album from Arctic Monkeys, is the wildly successful record that came at an interesting time in their career. To understand where this album comes from, you need some context about Arctic Monkeys' trajectory. They first hit the scene in 2002 and were met with wild acclaim from both critics and audiences for their loud, bold debut album, Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not. It was a heavy garage rock record with standout tracks like I Bet That You Look Good on the Dance Floor and the noticeably more laid-back Mardy Bum.</p>

        <p>This success carried into their second beloved album, Favourite Worst Nightmare, which took all the energy and excitement from their debut and channeled it into a more indie rock direction. Alex Turner's singing became more melodic, but the band still kept the energetic highs that made their first album so fun. The outro track 505 became hugely popular and even hinted at the direction they'd lean into more heavily in their later albums, particularly Suck It and See.</p>

        <p>At this point, Arctic Monkeys were still popular, but the release of their next two albums, Humbug and Suck It and See, marked a decline in their mainstream success. This was especially true with SIAS, where they mostly ditched the garage rock sound that had put them on the map, opting instead for a dreamier, more polished vibe. To regain their popularity while continuing to explore this new direction, the band needed to find a balance between the dreamy aesthetic and the more accessible indie rock. That's exactly what they did with AM, an album that became a defining indie rock staple of the 2010s.</p>

        <p>Even though I'm a pretty big Arctic Monkeys fan, I was kind of surprised I'd never actually sat down and listened to this album. Maybe it was because of some of the criticisms I've seen online, or the fact that I haven't been diving into a lot of new music lately. Either way, I was pretty excited going into this one, especially since I already loved some of its biggest hits like Do I Wanna Know?, R U Mine?, and Why'd You Only Call Me When You're High?. After listening a few times, I can say I still very much enjoy it, but I do have some reservations.</p>

        <p>Starting with the positives, Arctic Monkeys are incredible at crafting infectious guitar riffs and memorable choruses. Even tracks like No. 1 Party Anthem, which feel like pretty standard danceable rock songs, still manage to be fun, even if they're not particularly groundbreaking. That said, not every track on the album pulls off the stripped-back vibe well enough to keep me fully engaged. Songs like Mad Sounds and I Want It All are definitely enjoyable when I'm doing other things, and they work in certain contexts, but they don't quite grab me enough to keep me invested when I'm just sitting and listening.</p>

        <p>All of that aside, I do like the album. I think I'm being a little harsher because I hold Favourite Worst Nightmare and Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not in such high regardâ€”I'd easily rate both of those as 9s. But for what it is, AM is a pretty solid indie rock album. It's the kind of album you could imagine your immigrant mom listening to and not complaining that it hurts her ears, and that's honestly a win in my book.</p>
